### Destination for Cryptocurrency Price Notifications and Alerts

CoinAlert Beta is the first iteration of an app that will deliver price notifications and alerts for different cryptocurrencies. The current version has been submitted for approval to be distributed to external testers via Test Flight.

## Current Functionality

Current functionality includes:

1. Price notifications on up to 16 different cryptocurrencies
2. Variable notification frequency
  - 15 minutes
  - 30 minutes
  - 1 hour
  - 2 hours
  - 4 hours
  - 8 hours
  - 1 day
  - No notifications
3. View current price data on the top 1000 cryptocurrencies

## Future Improvements

Prior to delivering the final iteration to the App Store for mass use, the app will add the ability to create custom price notifications. 
For example, "when BTC passes $100,000, send me an alert." 

## Privacy

CoinAlert Beta stores no sensitive user data since there is no sign-in and no way to link any device with a specific individual.
